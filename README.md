We have at our disposal a dataset for the sale of computer games in the online store "Streamchik". Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. It is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), an association that determines the age rating of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it a suitable age category, for example, "For adults", "For younger children" or "For teenagers"
